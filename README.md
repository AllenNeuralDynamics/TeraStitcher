===========================================================

Main features:

- designed for very large images (terabyte-sized or more)
- fast and reliable stitching based on a multi-MIP approach
- typical memory requirement of ~2 Gigabytes or less
- both 3D and 2D stitching supported
- support for image files bigger than 2 GB 
- data subset selection
- support for sparse data
- regular expression based matching for image filenames
- i/o plugin-based architecture
